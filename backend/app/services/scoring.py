"""Free-tempo tap scoring.

The student taps at whatever speed feels natural, so absolute timing is meaningless.
Instead the first tap is anchored to the first expected note, the student's tempo is
inferred from the overall span of their taps, and each note is judged by how far (in
beats) the corresponding tap landed from where the notation says it should.
