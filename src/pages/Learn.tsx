        <p>
          Rhythm is the part of sheet music that tells you <em>when</em> to play and{' '}
          <em>how long</em> each sound lasts. You can ignore pitch entirely and still read
          rhythm — which is exactly what this trainer does. Every exercise is written on a
          single line because only the horizontal dimension (time) matters here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Music is divided into <strong>beats</strong> — the steady pulse you tap your foot
          to. Notes are symbols that occupy some number of beats. Reading rhythm means
          looking at a string of symbols and knowing the proportions between them: this one
          is twice as long as that one, this one falls halfway between two beats, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the exercises, you tap the <strong>TAP button</strong> once for every note, at
          the moment the note begins. You choose the speed; the trainer only checks that
          the <em>proportions</em> between your taps match the notation. Never tap during
          a rest, and never tap the second note of a tie — more on both below.

          Each note shape stands for a duration. The <strong>whole note</strong> (a hollow
          oval with no stem) is the longest common value: four beats. The{' '}
          <strong>half note</strong> (hollow, with a stem) lasts two beats. The{' '}
          <strong>quarter note</strong> (filled, with a stem) lasts one beat — in most
          music the quarter note <em>is</em> the beat.

        <p>
          The crucial skill: a half note isn't just "a longer note" — it is{' '}
          <em>exactly twice</em> a quarter note. When you tap a half note followed by two
          quarters, the gap after your first tap must be exactly twice as long as the gap
          after your second.

          The two stacked numbers at the start of a piece are the{' '}
          <strong>time signature</strong>. The top number says how many beats are in each{' '}
          <strong>measure</strong> (the space between two vertical barlines); the bottom
          number says which note value gets one beat. <strong>4/4</strong> means four
          quarter-note beats per measure. <strong>3/4</strong> — waltz time — means three.

        <p>
          Measures are bookkeeping: the notes inside every measure must add up to exactly
          the number of beats the time signature promises. When you read a new rhythm,
          checking that each measure adds up is the fastest way to make sure you've
          understood every symbol in it.

          A <strong>rest</strong> is measured silence. Every note value has a matching
          rest: the whole rest hangs below a staff line, the half rest sits on top of one,
          the quarter rest is the squiggle, and the eighth rest looks like a small flag.
          Rests take up time exactly like notes do — you just don't tap them.

          The discipline rests teach is <em>counting through silence</em>. Beginners rush
          rests because nothing is happening. Keep the pulse going in your head during the
          rest so the next note lands exactly where it should.

        <p>
          An <strong>eighth note</strong> lasts half a beat, so two of them fit evenly
          inside one quarter-note beat. On its own an eighth note has a flag on its stem;
          when several appear in a row they are joined by a <strong>beam</strong> — a
          thick horizontal bar — to make the beat groupings easy to see.
        </p>

          A useful habit is to count eighth notes with "and": <em>one-and-two-and…</em>.

        <p>
          A small dot after a note head adds <strong>half the note's own value</strong> to
          its length. A dotted half note is 2 + 1 = 3 beats. A dotted quarter is 1 + ½ =
          1½ beats. The most common dotted figure by far is the{' '}
          <strong>dotted quarter followed by an eighth</strong>: a long-short pair that
          adds up to exactly two beats.

        <p>
          When tapping, the giveaway of a correct dotted rhythm is the <em>snap</em> of the
          short note arriving late in the beat — three times as much time passes after the
          dotted note as after the eighth that follows it.

        <p>
          A <strong>tie</strong> is a curved line connecting two notes <em>of the same
          pitch</em>. It glues their durations together into one longer sound: you play the
          first note and simply keep holding through the second. Ties exist to write
          durations that cross a barline or that no single symbol can express.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>In the exercises, never tap the second note of a tie.</strong> It is the
          continuation of a sound you already started. A tie is not a slur (which connects
          different pitches and is about phrasing, not duration) — in a rhythm-only
          context, a curved line always means "hold".

          A <strong>sixteenth note</strong> lasts a quarter of a beat — four of them fill
          one beat. They carry two flags, or a double beam when grouped. Mixed groups of
          eighths and sixteenths create most of the rhythmic vocabulary you'll meet in real
          music.

          <strong>Syncopation</strong> means putting emphasis where the listener doesn't
          expect it — on the weak part of the beat, or between beats — and then{' '}
          <em>holding</em> through the strong beat that follows. It's what makes rhythm

          The classic example is the <strong>Charleston</strong> figure: a dotted quarter
          followed by a note that is tied over the next strong beat. To tap syncopation
          accurately, keep the underlying pulse rock-steady in your head and let your taps
          deliberately miss it.
